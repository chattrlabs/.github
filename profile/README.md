## Not That Chattr

Some folks built a Chattr for R — that’s cool for niche researchers.  
**Ours runs in Python, containers, and clusters — where AI actually scales.**

Because the future isn’t “one more chatbot.”
The future is voice → knowledge → chat, stitched together with duct tape, Docker, and dreams.

We don’t build apps.
We build pipelines.

🧠 Intelligence Wasn’t Invented

It was tapped into.

Like bandwidth, like electricity, like compute cycles that scream at you to “please fuck off or upgrade to enterprise”.
We’re not parasites — we’re founders. And founders leech different.

What We Actually Believe

Comfort → if it takes 7 flags and 3 backslashes to run, we’ll script it for you.

Quality → normalize everything (audio and vibes).

Vision → modular as LEGO, scalable as Kubernetes, cooler than Balenciaga SaaS.

Humor → because if we can’t joke about fart detection pipelines, why even run venv?

What Chattr Isn’t

It’s not built for everyone.

It’s not a single script pretending to be a “platform.”

It’s not afraid to admit: sometimes your TTY has no copy-paste and you will suffer.

---

What Chattr Is

A modular AI pipeline.

A founder’s notebook disguised as infrastructure.

A place where research, hacking, and sarcasm meet.

---

Chattr Labs — where founders tap into intelligence,
and geeks laugh while the logs scroll. 
We’re not chasing hype.
We’re chasing comfort, quality, and the quiet flex of watching 108 words/sec transcribe on a headless Proxmox box while your friends still think “AI” means asking Siri for the weather.
